# Ocaml Dev

I've been doing some ocaml work lately. This is a Vagrant file and recipies
for setting up a fresh ocaml development box.

Whatever directory you have in your `OCAML_SYNC` will be synced with the Vagrant
VM.

I normally work on my projects in Emacs on my Mac but run tests etc. in the
Vagrant VM.

## Setting it up

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant up
```

This will take quite a while.

Then `vagrant ssh` and get to work.
